# Laravel RR

A very simple repo which combines Laravel with the power of Roadrunner

- [More About Roadrunner](https://roadrunner.dev/)

## Why?

I needed to create several projects using Laravel and wanted to host them with Roadrunner for increased performance.

So I decided to setup a simple repository I can use as a start point for futher applications.

I will maintain a working Laravel -> Roadrunner integration here as updates are released.
